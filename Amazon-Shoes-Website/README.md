# Amazon-Shoes-Website
I have created an e-commerce shoes website with the help of HTML CSS Bootstrap and JavaScript. To this, main category filters like man, women, kids, sports have been added and main checkbox filters like filter by types, tags, sizes and colors have also been added. And secondly I have also added add to cart functionality.
